Stop or Start all WebApps (Websites) in your subscription
=========================================================

            

**Stop-Start-All-WebApps** is a simple PowerShell workflow runbook that will help you automate the process of stopping or starting every single WebApp (Website) in your subscription.


The script receives two required parameters:


**Stop**: If set to true stop the WebApps (Websites) otherwise start the WebApps  (Websites)


**CredentialAssetName**: The name of a working Credential Asset (AutomationPSCredential)


 

You'll have to create a Credential Asset in order for the script to access your account.


Hope it helps!!!

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
